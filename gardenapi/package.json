To scrape the link (Chrome guide, other browsers are different) press F12 to inspect elements, and go to the network tab. Then, load up the station of choice and click the Media tab. Whatever link is downloading, right click and copy the link. That should be the stream link. The more contributors I have, the better. I will give credit to everyone who helps.",
